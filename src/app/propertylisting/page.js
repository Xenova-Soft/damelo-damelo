                        <br/>
                        <p className="font-bold text-lg">1. Upload the best photos you have and, if possible, a map with the rooms' layout</p>
                        <div>
                            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mx-10">
                                <li><strong>Have quality photos at hand</strong> when posting your listing. You can add them later, but without them, you won't see results. </li>
                                <li><strong>The cover photo is crucial.</strong> It will be the front page of your listing, the only one that will be emailed to those interested in your listing and will appear in the results lists.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arrange your photos in a logical order</strong> to create a compelling story, and go for horizontal images, as they look great. </li>
                                <li><strong>Even a hand-drawn floor plan</strong>, while not detailed, provides useful information for those interested so they can visualise the layout of the rooms and what it would be like to live there. </li>

                    <br/>
                    <p className="font-bold text-lg">2. Enter the extact address</p>
                    <p>To make sure people looking in the area find out about your listing, <strong>you must provide an accurate address for your property</strong>. If, for some reason, you don't want to give it, you can <strong>hide the address for 9.90 â‚¬</strong>.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p className="font-bold text-lg">3. Enter a price that's in line with the market value</p>
                    <p>If you're not sure, you can do a <a href="#" className="text-blue-600 underline">free property valuation</a> via our website or check the average prices for that area.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p className="font-bold text-lg">4. Enter your property's characteristics and describe your home in detail</p>
                    <p>Include information about your property, such as the number of bedrooms, m2, bathrooms, etc. Also mention extras, like if there is a lift, a terrace, a parking space, a storage room, etc. In the end, <strong>it all adds value to your property</strong>.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong>Highlight your property's unique features</strong>, especially those not visible in the photos. Don't forget to mention nearby services, public transport and places of interest too.</p>
